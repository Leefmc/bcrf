'''The modules within the BCRF Project's root directory is a collection of
scripts designed to be directly run from within Blender. These do anything from
generate the main interface to BCRF, to create a collection of standardized
tests to test the framework and/or rig modules.

@note: This immediate root is the only package with scripts designed to be run
directly from within Blender. The rest of BCRF is, well, a framework.'''
