'''This package is the generic framework to aid in creating, updating, and
managing BCRF specific GUI elements in Blender. Everything from the main
interface to BCRF, to the popup menus for rigs.

@deprecated: Note that this may be removed. It is unknown to what extent a
gui helper library is even needed. Currently L{bcrf.gui} is showing that it
can handle the job, though it may become chopped up, and placed inside here.
So long story short.. who knows.
