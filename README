REQUIREMENTS:
    - Blender 2.46+
    - Python 2.5+

INSTALLATION:
    - None, at the moment.

USAGE:
    - Currently, basic usage is being implemented through running blender/gui.py
    directly from within Blender. In the near future, as the framework develops,
    other gui-less python scripts will develop to produce some standardized
    testing methods, along with basic usage (basic humanoid rig, perhaps).

REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
    - epydoc 3.0:
        BMRF code uses epydoc as its officially documentation generator. When
        documenting, it is required that the proper epydoc format is used.
        See http://epydoc.sourceforge.com for documentation.
        
        Note that you do not need to download epydoc if you do not want to
        generate documentation. You do however, need to follow the epydoc
        formatting rules so that others can generate documentation of your code.
    - Git:
        BMRF Uses Git & Github as the official Version Control System.
        
        Git: http://git.or.cz/
        Github: http://www.github.com

SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
    - WingIDE 3.1:
        Although not required, WingIDE has some debug options supplied in the
        blender package. (eg: wingide-blender_gui.py)
        To obtain a trial version, or use the free version of WingIDE,
        visit http://www.wingware.com/downloads
        
        More IDEs will be supported in the near future.
