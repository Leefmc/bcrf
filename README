REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
    - epydoc 3.0:
        BMRF code uses epydoc as its officially documentation generator. When
        documenting, it is required that the proper epydoc format is used.
        See http://epydoc.sourceforge.com for documentation.
        
        Note that you do not need to download epydoc if you do not want to
        generate documentation. You do however, need to follow the epydoc
        formatting rules so that others can generate documentation of your code.
    - Git:
        BMRF Uses Git & Github as the official Version Control System.
        
        Git:
