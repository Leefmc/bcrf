REQUIREMENTS:
    - Blender 2.46+
    - Python 2.5+

INSTALLATION:
    - Copy the bcrf directory, found in the same directory as this README, and
    place it inside your ~/.blender/scripts folder. Next, simply open Blender
    and load the python script of your choice. Generally, you'll want the main
    GUI interface to BCRF, in which case, find, load, and execute
    ~/.blender/scripts/bcrf/gui.py.
    
    - Note to developers: An improved method for developer loading is requested,
    but currently the method is to add in your
    /usr/local/lib/python25/site-packages folder, a symbolic link to
    /your/bcrf/developing/location/src/bcrf. This allows you to place your Git
    managed clone where ever you like.

USAGE:
    - Currently, basic usage is being implemented through running blender/gui.py
    directly from within Blender. In the near future, as the framework develops,
    other gui-less python scripts will develop to produce some standardized
    testing methods, along with basic usage (basic humanoid rig, perhaps).

REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
    - epydoc 3.0:
        BCRF code uses epydoc as its officially documentation generator. When
        documenting, it is required that the proper epydoc format is used.
        See http://epydoc.sourceforge.com for documentation.
        
        Note that you do not need to download epydoc if you do not want to
        generate documentation. You do however, need to follow the epydoc
        formatting rules so that others can generate documentation of your code.
    - Git:
        BCRF Uses Git & Github as the official Version Control System.

SUPPORTED DEVELOPMENT TOOLS:
    - WingIDE 3.1:
        Although not required, WingIDE has some debug options supplied in the
        blender package. (eg: wingide-blender_gui.py)
        To obtain a trial version, or use the free version of WingIDE,
        visit http://www.wingware.com/downloads
        
        More IDEs will be supported in the near future.
